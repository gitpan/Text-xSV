0.06  Sat Nov  1 23:45:00 PST 2003
        - Fix misnaming of bind_header in documentation
        - Apply patch from Klaus Weidner <kw@w-m-p.com>
          for segmentation faults on large fields
        - Switch to Module::Build
        - Add alias, delete, get_fields.
        - Add support for arbitrary computed fields with
          add_compute.
0.07  Mon Nov  3 8:30:00 PST 2003
        - Hopefully fix caching test that was broken on Win32
          (I strongly suspect due to different behaviour of
          "local").  The fix also avoids a theroetical bug
          that I had not thought through with multiple xSV
          objects whose computes call each other.
0.08 Sun Dec  7 11:49:39 PST 2003
        - Made it ignore \r by default (helps *nix users who
          are reading Windows files).
        - Allow people to set arbitrary error handling routines.
        - Added extract_hash and fetchrow_hash utility
          functions.  I may add more of these later.
