0.06  Sat Nov  1 23:45:00 PST 2003
        - Fix misnaming of bind_header in documentation
        - Apply patch from Klaus Weidner <kw@w-m-p.com>
          for segmentation faults on large fields
        - Switch to Module::Build
        - Add alias, delete, get_fields.
        - Add support for arbitrary computed fields with
          add_compute.
0.07  Mon Nov  3 8:30:00 PST 2003
        - Hopefully fix caching test that was broken on Win32
          (I strongly suspect due to different behaviour of
          "local").  The fix also avoids a theroetical bug
          that I had not thought through with multiple xSV
          objects whose computes call each other.
0.08 Sun Dec  7 11:49:39 PST 2003
        - Made it ignore \r by default (helps *nix users who
          are reading Windows files).
        - Allow people to set arbitrary error handling routines.
        - Added extract_hash and fetchrow_hash utility
          functions.  I may add more of these later.
0.09 Mon Mar 15 02:00:00 PST 2004
        - Fixed bug where row_size would reset on error.
          (Reported by Rob Kinyon.)
        - Fixed false claim about Text::CSV.
        - Made bind_headers an alias for bind_header.
	- Made open_file not just be for reads.  Documented it.
	- Added set_row_size.  Documented it.
	- Gave reasonable defaults if both fh and filename are
	  missing.  Documented it.
	- Made row_size warning optional with set_row_size_warning.
	  per request from Chad Simmons.  Documented it.
	- Added format_* functions.  Documented them.
	- Added print_* functions.  Documented them.

0.10 Mon Mar 15 09:00:00 PST 2004
        - Forgot date on version 0.09.
        - Empty string when saved and read would come back as undef.
          Fixed.

0.11 Tue Mar 16 08:00:00 PST 2004
        - Fix set_sep redefinition bug caught by warnings.
        - Remove = in a conditional warnings.
        - Add -w to test.pl so that I won't miss future warnings. :-)
        - Add set_warning_handler.  Documented it.
        - Documentation fixes.
        - Added set_close_fh.  Documented it.  (May remove.)
        - Added read_header and read_headers.  Removed bind_headers.
          Documented bind_header as deprecated.

0.12 Tue Sep 28 08:14:03 PDT 2004
        - Make sure that error_handler is set up before it might be called.
        - Update my email address.
        - Update the date on the copyright notice.

0.13 Tue Sep 28 08:35:57 PDT 2004
        - Make the fallback fh be ARGV instead of STDIN.  This is NOT
          backwards compatible.  However it is a significantly more
          useful default.  If I accidentally broke your script, I
          apologize.  Tell me if I ever meet you and I'll owe you a
          beer or equivalent.

0.14 Sat Apr 10 00:20 PDT 2005
        - Change Module::Build to use traditional rather than passthrough.
	- Document internally why the "single character seperator" limit
	  exists.
	- Add a couple of tests.

0.15 Sun May 29 13:00 PDT 2005
        - Apply patch from Gyepi SAM to prevent warning on fetchrow_hash
	  at end of file.
	- Point out that bind_headers does not have a consistent return.
	  This is not a bug.
	- Allow fetchrow_hash and extract_hash to take a list of arguments
	  of the fields that you want extracted.

0.16 Tue Oct  2 17:33 PDT 2007
	- Fix DESTROY bug reported by Fred Steinberg.
