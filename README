This is a pure Perl module for reading CSV-type formats.

Features:

  o Line oriented.  (ie Doesn't slurp the whole file.)

  o Handles embedded commas, returns, and quotes properly.

  o Simple interface.

  o It attempts to give informative errors on problems in the file.

Drawbacks:

  o It is not optimized for performance.

  o It is strongly oriented towards reading data from a file.

  o Any use of the special variables $`, $&, or $' will slow it
    significantly.
